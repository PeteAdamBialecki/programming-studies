A new version of D3.js (version 4.0) was released on June 28th, 2016. This version changed the names of many of the functions in the library. From the release notes:

... one unavoidable consequence of adopting ES6 modules: every symbol in D3 4.0 now shares a flat namespace rather than the nested one of D3 3.x. For example, d3.scale.linear is now d3.scaleLinear, and d3.layout.treemap is now d3.treemap.

This means that the D3 code we have in this material will not work with version 4 of D3.js. We're working on updating the code, but for now, please keep this in mind as you are working through the course. Feel free to use either version 3 or version 4 for the final project.
